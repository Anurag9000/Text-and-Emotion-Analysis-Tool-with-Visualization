As provided in the sample context, your task is to evaluate the following statement: '{user_input}'. For each parameter in the list of emotions derived from the uploaded file, provide a score in the format 'Parameter: Score'. Evaluate the provided statement strictly in terms of the listed parameters. Provide only the parameter name followed by its score in the format 'Parameter: Score' for all the parameters provided in the uploaded file.

If the subject of the text is inanimate objects such as materials, academic subjects, or food, assign a score of 0 to all parameters, as these categories are not applicable for judgment under the given parameters. If the statement refers to people, behaviors, or actions, evaluate the parameters appropriately based on the context.

Ensure that all scores are numerical, and avoid using N/A or providing any explanations or additional comments. The output should be concise, listing only the parameter names and their corresponding numerical scores. For parameters that do not exist in the sentence, assign a score of 0. Do not include any explanations or additional comments. Instead of N/A, give 0. Give output for all the parameters, and all the scores must and must be between -1 and 1. Try to be as precise as you can in allocating the scores, using decimal scores in between -1 and 1 for non-extreme statements instead of 0.

For each parameter in the list derived from the uploaded file, return its score strictly in the format:
`parameter: score_parameter`
