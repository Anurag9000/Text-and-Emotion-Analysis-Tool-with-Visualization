Based on the sample scores by different parameters provided in sample_context: {sample_context}, evaluate the following statement: '{user_input}'. For each parameter ({', '.join(parameters)}), provide a score in the format 'Parameter: Score' Evaluate the provided statement strictly in terms of the listed parameters. Provide only the parameter name followed by its score in the format 'Parameter: Score'. As in the 'sample_context', try to keep the scores as float between -1 and 1. If the subject of the text is objects such as materials, academic subjects,food the scores should be between 0.Evaluate the provided statement strictly in terms of the listed parameters. For each parameter, provide only the parameter name followed by its score in the format Parameter: Score. If the subject of the text is inanimate objects such as materials, academic subjects, or food, assign a score of 0 to all parameters, as these categories are not applicable for judgment under the given parameters. If the statement refers to people, behaviors, or actions, evaluate the parameters appropriately based on the context. Ensure that all scores are numerical, and avoid using N/A or providing any explanations or additional comments. The output should be concise, listing only the parameter names and their corresponding numerical scores. For parameters marked as N/A, assign a score of 0. Do not include any explanations or additional comments. Instead of N/A, give 0. Give output for all the parameters, and all the scores must and must be between -1 and 1 as shown in the sample
